# Linear-Time-Invariant--LTI--Control-System_Controls_3.5B
Write a MATLAB-Simulink program to simulate the responses  of states 洧논1 (洧노) and 洧논2 (洧노) of system (2) with the initial conditions:  洧논1 (0) 洧논2 (0) =  0 1  and the  input signal 洧녹(洧노) is a unit step function. Compare the analytical vs. computational  solutions of the responses of states 洧논1 (洧노) and 洧논2 (洧노) by plotting them together. Please  remember to label the axes and title the plots.
